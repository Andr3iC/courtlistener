        <h2>APIs and Bulk Data</h2>
        <p>We currently have two free APIs available to developers using our
            platform. If you are interested in obtaining large quantities of
            our data, we recommend using our <a href="{% url "bulk_data_index" %}">bulk
                API</a>, which provides compressed JSON files of our entire
            collection, by jurisdiction. If you wish to query our data
            programatically, we recommend using our <a
                    href="{% url "rest_docs" %}">REST APIs</a>.

                <p>
                    Over the past several years, we have made a significant investment in
                    making our data the best on the open Web.
                    Among the minor enhancements we make on a regular basis, we've made
                    significant improvements to our data that you won't find in other
                    sources:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We've <a href="https://free.law/2011/05/25/updated-supreme-court-case-dates-and-the-first-release-of-early-scotus-data-in-machine-readable-form/">
                        added exact dates from the library of congress</a> to our collection
                        of older Supreme Court cases, enhancing thousands of cases beyond what's
                        available anywhere else.
                    </li>
                    <li>When we imported the Resource.org data, we <a href="https://free.law/2011/08/25/second-series-of-federal-reporter-from-1950-to-1993-now-on-courtlistener/">
                        manually corrected</a> more than ten thousand omissions or
                        errors in the data, ensuring that it's complete and accurate.
                    </li>
                    <li>Our data has <a href="https://free.law/2012/05/11/building-a-citator-on-courtlistener/">
                        the citation network</a>, showing which cases reference each
                        other, saving you the effort of building and testing a citation
                        finding and matching algorithm yourself. Currently, we're working with
                        researchers at USC to complete an audit of the citation network, the
                        results of which will be folded back into our corpus.
                    </li>
                    <li>We complete complicated cleanup routines on the data, eliminating and
                        fixing errant abbreviations like 'et al', 'U.S.A.' and the like.
                    </li>
                    <li>The data on CourtListener is a combination of many partial sources such
                        as court websites, <a href="https://public.resource.org/">Public.Resource.Org</a>,
                        and a donation from <a href="http://lawboxapps.com">Lawbox LLC.</a>
                        This means that we have the best parts of all of our sources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We help you identify opinions that should be private. Many people don't want their
                        case on the Web and have contacted us or Resource.org. In our data
                        we provide a field indicating which cases should be kept private. In
                        addition, we provide research about how to keep these cases out of
                        search engines (more detail at right).

                <h3 id="privacy">Privacy Concerns</h3>
                <p>As is explained in our <a href="/removal/">removal policy</a>, we
                    have blocked public search engines from indexing many of the cases available
                    in our data (though they remain in our search engine).
                    As you work with this data, please be cognizant of the privacy and safety
                    issues involved with public-facing legal documents. This impacts real people
                    with privacy issues such as jailed informants, women avoiding stalkers,
                    foreign citizens with rejected asylum requests, children who were named
                    incidentally in a case about their parent's wrongdoings, etc.</p>

                <p>If you intend to respect the privacy wishes of the parties involved,
                    there is a field for each case, "<strong>blocked</strong>," which
                    describes whether we have blocked search engines from indexing the
                    case. The simple thing for you to do is to continue blocking
                    such cases.</p>

                <p>For our approach to blocking, please see our <a href="/removal/">removal
                    policy</a>. For our technical approach, please see the blog entries below. If
                    you believe Robots.txt prevents a URL from appearing in search results,
                    please be sure to check these out (it likely does not work as you expect):
